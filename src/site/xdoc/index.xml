    <section name="Jackcess Encrypt">
      <p>
        Jackcess Encrypt is an extension library for the <a href="https://jackcess.sourceforge.io/">Jackcess</a> project
        which implements support for some forms of Microsoft Access and
        Microsoft Money encryption.  Jackcess Encrypt is licensed under the
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt">Apache License</a> (as of version 2.1.0).
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is separate from the main Jackcess project for two main
        reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>The encryption support requires an additional library (<a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html">Bouncy Castle</a>).
              Making this support separate from the main Jackcess library
              allows users to avoid including unnecessary libraries.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Bouncy Castle Compatability - the Bouncy Castle library
                    made a binary incompatible change in version 1.51.
                    Versions of Jackcess Encrypt 2.1.0 and earlier are only
                    compatible with Bouncy Castle 1.50 and earlier.  Jackcess
                    Encrypt 2.1.1 updated to Bouncy Castle 1.52, but added a
                    shim layer which maintains compability with earlier
                    versions of Bouncy Castle as well (see <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jackcessencrypt/feature-requests/2/">Feature
                    Request 2</a> for more details).</li>
              </ul>
          <li>Sourceforge previously had restrictions on the distribution of
              software which used encryption.  Keeping this support in a
              separate project allowed the main Jackcess library to be
              distributed more freely.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <subsection name="Java 9+ Compatibility (2021-TBD)">
        <p>
          While Jackcess Encrypt still only requires Java 8+, as of the 4.0.0
          release it now includes an Automatic-Module-Name of
          <code>com.healthmarketscience.jackcess.crypt</code> in its manifest.
          That allows it to be used in the module path for Java 9+ projects.
          These changes correspond with the changes in Jackess 4.x.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a consequence of supporting Java 9+ modules, the classes in this
          project needed to be moved to a new package in order to avoid the
          "split module" problem.  The primary classes in this project are now
          in the <code>com.healthmarketscience.jackcess.crypt</code> package.
          This is a breaking change with respect to the 3.x release series.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Java 8+ Support (2019-02-09)">
        <p>
          Jackcess Encrypt now requires Java 8+ as of the 3.0.0 release.  All
          third party dependencies have been updated to the latest versions.
          These changes correspond with the changes in Jackess 3.0.0.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Brand New License! (2015-04-16)">
        <p>
          In order to match the License changes made in <a href="https://jackcess.sourceforge.io/changes-report.html#a2.1.0">Jackcess 2.1.0</a>, the
          Jackcess Encrypt project has been relicensed under the <b>Apache

      <subsection name="Jackcess Encrypt 2.0 (2013-08-26)">
        <p>
          In order to match the API changes made in <a href="https://jackcess.sourceforge.io/jackcess-2.html">Jackess 2.0</a>, the Jackcess
          Encrypt project has made a similar version change.  Read the

    <section name="Sample code">
      <p>
        This project's encryption support can be utilized by providing a
        CryptCodecProvider when opening an Access Database.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open a Database with normal Jet file encoding:
          <source>Database db = new DatabaseBuilder(myDbFile)
  .setCodecProvider(new CryptCodecProvider())
  .open();</source>
        </li>
        <li>Open a Database with an encoding which requires a password to
            decode:
            <source>Database db = new DatabaseBuilder(myDbFile)
  .setCodecProvider(new CryptCodecProvider("MyDbPassword"))
  .open();</source>
        </li>
