      <p>
        Jackcess Encrypt is an extension library for the <a href="https://jackcess.sourceforge.io/">Jackcess</a> project
        which implements support for some forms of Microsoft Access and
        Microsoft Money encryption.  Jackcess Encrypt is licensed under the
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt">Apache License</a> (as of version 2.1.0).
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is separate from the main Jackcess project for two main
        reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>The encryption support requires an additional library (<a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html">Bouncy Castle</a>).
              Making this support separate from the main Jackcess library
              allows users to avoid including unnecessary libraries.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Bouncy Castle Compatability - the Bouncy Castle library
                    made a binary incompatible change in version 1.51.
                    Versions of Jackcess Encrypt 2.1.0 and earlier are only
                    compatible with Bouncy Castle 1.50 and earlier.  Jackcess
                    Encrypt 2.1.1 updated to Bouncy Castle 1.52, but added a
                    shim layer which maintains compability with earlier
                    versions of Bouncy Castle as well (see <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jackcessencrypt/feature-requests/2/">Feature
                    Request 2</a> for more details).</li>
              </ul>
          <li>Sourceforge has <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Project%20control#ExportControl">restrictions</a>
              on the distribution of software which use encryption.  Keeping
              this support in a separate project allows the main Jackcess
              library to be distributed more freely.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <subsection name="Java 8+ Support (2019-02-09)">
        <p>

    <section name="Sample code">
      <p>
        This project's encryption support can be utilized by providing a
        CryptCodecProvider when opening an Access Database.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open a Database with normal Jet file encoding:
          <source>Database db = new DatabaseBuilder(myDbFile)
  .setCodecProvider(new CryptCodecProvider())
  .open();</source>
        </li>
        <li>Open a Database with an encoding which requires a password to
            decode:
            <source>Database db = new DatabaseBuilder(myDbFile)
  .setCodecProvider(new CryptCodecProvider("MyDbPassword"))
  .open();</source>
        </li>
